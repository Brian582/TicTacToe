# TicTacToe

This is a project I made using Python and SQLite.      

For this project, I made a TicTacTac game using Python where you can can play against another player or play against the computer.

Your also able to create an account to save your stats from the game or you can play as a guest.
Stats in the game would be how many times you won/lost a game and how many games you played in total. 

With SQL, I made a database that stores all the player's stats if they log in with their account. Nothing is saved when you play as a guest.

When the program runs, a menu will be displayed to show all the options that are available for the program.
